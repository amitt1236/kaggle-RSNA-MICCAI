# RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification

## Goal: Predict the status of a genetic biomarker important for brain cancer treatment
  
**Glioblastoma-** is the most common form of brain cancer and considered the deadliest human cancer.

**MGMT promoter methylation-** is the key mechanism of MGMT gene silencing and predicts a favorable outcome in patients with glioblastoma who are exposed to alkylating agent chemotherapy.

we're not trying o detect tumors, since all the images in train and test sets have tumors. we're trying to predict whether or not chemotherapy will be an effective treatment, and that is done by predicting the genetic subtype of glioblastoma, and more specifically the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.
